## 1. Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their measurements.

**Dataset:** The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) consists of 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Project Structure:**

- `Iris_Flower_Classification/`
  - `data/`: Contains the dataset.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
  - `models/`: Saved trained models.
  - `README.md`: Detailed documentation specific to this project.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis with Python

**Objective:** Analyze unemployment rates, particularly focusing on the surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, using Python.

**Dataset:** The project utilizes publicly available unemployment data.

**Project Structure:**

- `Unemployment_Analysis_with_Python/`
  - `data/`: Contains the unemployment dataset.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
  - `reports/`: Generated reports and findings.
  - `README.md`: Detailed documentation specific to this project.

## 3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on factors such as brand reputation, features, horsepower, and mileage.

**Dataset:** The project employs a dataset encompassing various car features and their corresponding prices.

**Project Structure:**

- `Car_Price_Prediction_with_ML/`
  - `data/`: Contains the car price dataset.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
  - `models/`: Saved trained models.
  - `README.md`: Detailed documentation specific to this project.
